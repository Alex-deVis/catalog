# Rust Tiny-HTTP Server

This directory contains a simple HTTP server written in Rust using [tiny-http](https://github.com/tiny-http/tiny-http) running with Unikraft.
The image opens up a simple HTTP server and provides a simple HTML response for each request.

To run this example, install [Unikraft's companion command-line toolchain `kraft`](https://unikraft.org/docs/cli) and [the `nightly` Rust toolchain channel through Rustup](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

## Build

To build the image, clone this repository and `cd` into this directory.
You can then build the project with:

```bash
KRAFTKIT_TARGET=http-rs cargo +nightly build -Z build-std=std,panic_abort --target x86_64-unikraft-linux-musl
```

In the above command, `KRAFTKIT_TARGET=http-rs` makes the name of the application known to `kraftld`.
Rust for Unikraft currently only supports the `qemu/x86_64` target.
If a `Kraftfile` contains more targets, the correct one can be selected through the `KRAFTKIT_PLAT` and `KRAFTKIT_ARCH` environment variables.

## Run

In order to run the locally built image, use `kraft`:

```bash
kraft run --rm --plat qemu --arch x86_64 -p 8080:8080 .
```

Once executed, it will open port `8080` and wait for connections.
To test it, you can use `curl`:

```bash
curl localhost:8080
```

You should see a "Hello, world!" message.
